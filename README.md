## Overview

  This challenge was really interesting... I got some problems with floating boxes, but I got a result that I really liked.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

[Mobile (a little scroll that doesn't appear on the screenshot)](./images/mobile.png)

## My process


  This one took me a while to properly display all the boxes. Kinda fun, though!

### Built with

- (Kinda) Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

  I'll try to redo this one and use CSS grid instead of floating boxes.
